Passport is relatively easy to work with.

You can follow the documentation (located here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/passport) and follow along to install and create the nessicary files for a base authentication application.

As most of the files do not exist, there should no merge conflicts (if any) when pushing to the main branch.

Oauth is generated in our home.blade.php file allowing for manual creation of users and passwords.

The process is very generalized and could probably be refined to be more specific to our program, but as of now it works.
